<div id="about" class="about"><h1>About</h1><br>I haven't made a website in over 10 years, so let's just say: here I go ruining everything. And not in the fun, Adam Conover way.<br>My website will eventually feature more things than just a main page with my instagram feed. I, however, have a limited amount of content that I want on here right now. <br>Full background information, though, I have been drawing and creating art since I was very young. I wanted to become a type of creative developer, from a young age. I struggle with ADHD but did not know that until my late 20's, I would feel rejected when my works were not well recieved and this led to frustration and "giving up," a lot.<br>Currently, I'm in college again! Bullied myself just enough to slightly regret it a year later, but it's better than knowing I have this dream and doing nothing about it.</div>
<div>  <h2 class="work-header">This is just my instagram feed. I post art there more than on actual art sites.</h2>
